The list of these codes solve the task 1.4 (Item 1 to 3 only )
of section Numerical tasks (pg 3) in the Homework Set 1 document.

The functions chosen in Section 1.3(Model Problems) are:
1. Oscillatory
2. Product Peak
3. Continuous

The matlab functions that runs the tasks for functions above are named:

1. generalmodel.m
2. productpeak.m
3. continuous.m
